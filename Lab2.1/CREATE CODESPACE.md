## Create a GitHub Codespace

A codespace is a cloud-hosted development environment you can access from anywhere. It has everything you need, including a text editor, terminal, and debugger. Codespaces are powered by Visual Studio Code and run in a containerized environment. For this workshop, we are going to use codespaces to do our development.

1. Make sure that you are in your forked repository (_your-username/PPCC24-ALM) and then find and click on the **<> Code** button
1. On the **Code** pop up, select the **Codespaces** tab
1. Click **Create codespace on main**

    A codespace will now be created for you in a new tab. This will take a few seconds. But once it's done, you will have a fully functional Visual Studio Code environment in your browser. You can now start developing!
